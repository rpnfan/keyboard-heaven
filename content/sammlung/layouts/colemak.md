Colemak solves a problem which does not exist when you use a navigation/ shortcut layer (and home/bottom-row-mods): keeping xcv in the same location. So that is IMO only a theoretical plus, but not relevant any longer today with programmable keyboards and Kanata allowing way better solutions.
The second plus is that you do not need to learn as many new keys. That means you will learn the layout a bit faster. But the difference is IMO not really relevant when you take the time and learn a new layout anyways.
Third plus is that it is now available on the major platforms out of the box.
Negative (see 2 above) is that because it is similar to QWERTY you can get tripped up in the learning phase easier.
But the main reason I am not the greatest fan is that the right hand is way too busy -- to many one-handers. This something you feel, when you use the layout and get to a reasonable speed (> 50 wpm). See the graphics in the anymak:END article. It also has too many scissors and neighboring fingers, which do not feel good.
Last minus point (for some) is that it does not work well with non-English languages. Other layouts are way more robust in their performance there.
It is surely better than QWERTY although, if you want something "in the middle" and do not prefer Middlemak-NH.
