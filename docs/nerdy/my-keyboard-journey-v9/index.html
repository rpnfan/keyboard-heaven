<p>I learned touch typing as a teenager and typed extensively throughout my studies and career. Through sheer practice, my speed reached 60–70 WPM on real-world text with high accuracy.</p>
<p>I began to get annoyed with the keyboard as soon as I started using LaTeX and programming during my studies. The symbols I needed constantly—backslashes, brackets, curly braces, the @ symbol—were trapped behind the AltGr layer. AltGr isn&rsquo;t reachable from home row without uncomfortable hand contortions. And it&rsquo;s unreliable across different keyboards and systems.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I began using Vim. That experience taught me something important: keeping your hands on the home row is powerful. Moving your hands away breaks rhythm and slows you down. When I could navigate and edit without leaving home row in Vim, everything flowed better.</p>
<p>I realized I could apply that same principle to typing. The AltGr problem needed solving.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="20072022-deutschlandplus">2007–2022: DeutschlandPlus<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#20072022-deutschlandplus">#</a></h2>
<p>Years later, working in a lab with a German QWERTZ keyboard, I refined my solution. The CapsLock key on my keyboard never got used. What if I turned it into a layer modifier? Then I could access all those symbols from home row, plus bring navigation keys (arrows, Home, End, PageUp/Down) into reach—just like in Vim.</p>
<p>I created <strong>DeutschlandPlus</strong>, an Autohotkey script that transformed my keyboard into a more comfortable input device. When you held CapsLock, the right-hand keys became symbols and navigation. HJKL became arrow keys, just like in Vim. Brackets, braces, backslashes—all accessible without moving my hands.</p>
<p>It was simple and elegant. The solution maintained full compatibility with the standard QWERTZ layout. The extra layer was transparent to everyone else; I could run it on any lab computer without anyone noticing. No relearning needed—just a few days to get acquainted with the new features.</p>
<p>Around 2010, I looked into alternative keyboard layouts like Neo. But I decided not to abandon my years of QWERTZ practice. DeutschlandPlus felt like the right balance.</p>
<p>For 15 years, it was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2022-exploring-alternatives">2022: Exploring Alternatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2022-exploring-alternatives">#</a></h2>
<p>By 2022, after 15 years using DeutschlandPlus, I started wondering: <em>Could I do better?</em></p>
<p>The answer required something I&rsquo;d avoided: changing the base layout itself.</p>
<p>I tried Minimak—swapping just a few keys. But I quickly realized the gains would be limited. Next was Colemak. That works reasonably well for English, but it&rsquo;s much worse for non-English languages.</p>
<p>Because I type in German and Dutch besides English, I developed my own custom keyboard layout. Using Colemak&rsquo;s design principles (minimize changes, keep XCV on the left for shortcuts), I created a layout that achieved nearly Colemak&rsquo;s English performance while performing much better for German, Dutch, and other languages.</p>
<p>I practiced for about one month on keybr.com before making the full switch at around 40 WPM. As I got faster over the coming weeks and reached 50–60 WPM, I realized something disheartening: the left hand felt great, but the right hand was still too busy. Many patterns involved only or mainly the right hand. The improvement wasn&rsquo;t enough to justify the relearning.</p>
<p>I was disappointed. But then I realized something important: I&rsquo;d just proven that optimization <em>works</em>. A better layout <em>does</em> feel better. So why settle for partial optimization?</p>
<p>I decided to go the full way: find a fully optimized layout.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-breakthrough-discovering-opt-and-multi-language-optimization">The Breakthrough: Discovering &lsquo;opt&rsquo; and Multi-Language Optimization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-breakthrough-discovering-opt-and-multi-language-optimization">#</a></h2>
<p>Around the same time, I discovered Andreas Wettstein&rsquo;s &lsquo;opt&rsquo; optimizer, which had been used to create the AdNW and KOY layouts around 2010. These layouts, based on Dvorak principles, had proven to be excellent solutions for English and German typists.</p>
<p>Maximilian Schillinger&rsquo;s articles demonstrated how to use &lsquo;opt&rsquo; to develop and fine-tune personal layouts. I realized I could build a layout optimized specifically for English, German, and Dutch—the exact languages I typed.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of 2022 developing it. Using &lsquo;opt&rsquo; extensively, testing practically, tweaking manually. The result was <strong>END</strong> (English, Deutsch, Nederlands)—named after my goal: the final destination of my keyboard journey.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2023-learning-anymak--end">2023: Learning Anymak + END<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2023-learning-anymak--end">#</a></h2>
<p>In 2023, I refined the END layout further using &lsquo;opt&rsquo; and more practical testing. I also discovered something important about layers: <strong>Space as a modifier works better than CapsLock.</strong> Using Space as a layer trigger (SpaceFN) was easier to use and allowed both hands to participate, not just the right one. I integrated navigation keys, Enter, Backspace, Alt+Tab, copy/paste combos, and more.</p>
<p>Then came the real breakthrough: <strong>shifting Shift itself.</strong> Instead of keeping Shift in its default top-right position, I placed it on easy-to-reach keys—normally used for characters. But as one-shot modifiers (tap Shift, and the next keystroke gets capitalized), not held keys. This eliminated all finger strain from holding Shift.</p>
<p>I also discovered that the B-key had to be repositioned when designing for both standard row-staggered and split columnar keyboards. This constraint became a key design decision.</p>
<p>I named this complete system <strong>Anymak</strong>: the refined layer system paired with optimized alphanumeric layouts. The full name is <strong>anymak:END</strong>—Anymak layers on top of the END alphanumeric layout. Future variants would be anymak:COLEMAK, anymak:GRAPHITE, and so on.</p>
<p>Before switching, I practiced on keybr.com again—about 20 minutes most days—until I reached around 40 WPM. Then I switched for real.</p>
<p>The learning was intense at first. I reached 50–60 WPM after about one month. But true fluency—where typing felt as automatic and natural as QWERTZ had—took about 2 years. Remember, I&rsquo;d been typing QWERTZ for decades at that point. The muscle memory was deeply ingrained. The umlauts were the last thing to feel natural, because I&rsquo;d moved them to a layer—but this placement actually benefited from the symmetry of using the opposite hand for the layer-switch modifier, just like for Shift.</p>
<p>After the initial keybr.com practice, I didn&rsquo;t practice intensively during those 2 years of real-world use. This likely extended the fluency timeline. But it also proved something important: <strong>anymak:END works intuitively. You don&rsquo;t need obsessive drilling for it to become natural.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2024-finalized">2024: Finalized<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2024-finalized">#</a></h2>
<p>By 2024, I settled on the complete system with bottom-row modifiers and found hardware I&rsquo;m satisfied with—a customized Lily58 (a split keyboard) with a 1.75u wide main thumb key for more comfortable modifier access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not tweaking anymore. The system is optimized. The problem I set out to solve—symbols trapped behind AltGr, navigation unreachable from home row, and later, multi-language typing efficiency—is solved. And it works on both standard row-staggered keyboards and split ergonomic boards.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-learning-process-an-unexpected-insight">The Learning Process: An Unexpected Insight<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-learning-process-an-unexpected-insight">#</a></h2>
<p>This journey taught me something beyond keyboard comfort. I wanted to understand how to learn better—to transfer that knowledge to other areas, like practicing a musical instrument.</p>
<p>What I learned: <strong>consistent daily practice beats occasional marathon sessions.</strong> I improved more from 20 minutes daily on keybr.com than I would have from 3-hour weekend sessions. I also discovered that deeply ingrained patterns are hard to change—but it <em>is</em> possible if you&rsquo;re willing to invest the effort. And perhaps surprisingly, that effort doesn&rsquo;t have to be intense. Steady, consistent practice works.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-trade-off-comfort-vs-flexibility">The Trade-Off: Comfort vs. Flexibility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-trade-off-comfort-vs-flexibility">#</a></h2>
<p>I gained a genuinely comfortable typing experience. After decades of QWERTZ, my hands no longer ache. Typing flows. Patterns that were awkward now feel natural.</p>
<p>What I lost: flexibility. I can&rsquo;t walk into an office and type quickly on a shared keyboard. Work machines offer vanilla QWERTZ. I deliberately chose not to maintain active QWERTZ skills, because split attention would have made the learning process harder. But because I only use computers I control (my work laptop, a home desktop, my personal laptop), this flexibility loss doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The trade-off was worth it. For me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="for-your-own-journey">For Your Own Journey<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-your-own-journey">#</a></h2>
<p>This was my path. But you don&rsquo;t need to follow it completely. Many people find their sweet spot at DeutschlandPlus (a 15-year solution for good reason) or early Spacemak. Some stay there forever. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Your keyboard is something you touch thousands of times per day. If there&rsquo;s a problem worth solving, it&rsquo;s worth solving well. But &ldquo;well&rdquo; means different things to different people.</p>
<p>Your constraints—the machines you control, the time you have, the languages you type, whether you need flexibility—determine your path. Not ours.</p>
